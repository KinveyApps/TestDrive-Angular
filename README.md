# TestDrive-AngularJS
The TestDrive sample application provides you with a near blank template to get started with. It is great for learning and trying Kinvey, or to build your first application upon.

## Run It
After downloading or cloning the repository:

* Replace `App Key` and `App Secret` (`index.html`) with your applications credentials.
* Start a web server:
```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
* Point your browser to `http://localhost:8000/index.html`. Adjust the hostname and port number if necessary.

## Functionality
This application demonstrates:

* Basic set-up for AngularJS apps using Kinvey
* Pinging the service

## Architecture
The starting point of this application is `index.html`. Here, you will find placeholders and hints on where to put your application content, styles, and scripts. Code to connect your app with Kinvey is already inserted.

By default, the sample app includes a button to ping the Kinvey service. If you want to get rid of this functionality, simply remove `scripts/ping.js`, and delete the button HTML tag from `index.html`.
